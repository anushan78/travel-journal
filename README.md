# Travel Journal

A simple Next.js 14/15 project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, demonstrating routing, dynamic pages, and global styling.

## Features

- Next.js App Router (`app/` directory)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Turbopack-compatible PostCSS setup
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- Git

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Project Structure

/app        # Next.js app folder (pages and layouts)
  /components

  /page.tsx
postcss.config.js
tailwind.config.ts

### Tailwind CSS

✅ Notes:

- Keep it updated as you add features (e.g., dynamic pages, API calls, components).  
- You can include screenshots or GIFs under a `docs/` folder to make it more visual.

If you want, I can also **create a more “fancy” README** with badges, screenshots, and commands tailored for your Travel Journal project so it looks professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
